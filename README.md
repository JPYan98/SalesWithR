Decision Tree

## Conclusion

This essay conducted a dual-pronged analysis of a sales dataset using time series forecasting and predictive modelling. Predictive modelling, using logistic regression and decision trees, identified key predictors of transactions, such as checkout, visits, product clicks, and page views. While the logistic regression model demonstrated good discriminatory power, the first decision tree model's performance was slightly better. These findings provide valuable insights for businesses to optimize operations and boost profitability, underscoring the importance of data-driven decision-making.
